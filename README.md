## Introduction

This playground book consists of a simple browsing book, made more interactive, letting the user interact with it to discover which words may or may not have a common origin. It introduces the topic of a word's etymology in a ludic way. I used SwfitUI and NaturalLanguage frameworks to develop this project.

## Download

To experience this project, download the ".playgroundbook" file in this repository, and open it using Swift Playgrounds 3.4 or above for macOS (you can also use Playgrounds for iPad).
